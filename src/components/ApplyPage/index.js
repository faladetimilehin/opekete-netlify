                                    dissatisfaction at the current state of education and calibre of teachers available. She also derived passion in encouraging young girls
                                    who want to study nursing to do so, often trying to get one of her grand daughters to study nursing because she had the gift of caring for others.
                                    In the spirit of acting on her desire to see better teachers and nurses, Mrs Makanjuola set up the okpekete foundation with a few students being beneficiaries.
